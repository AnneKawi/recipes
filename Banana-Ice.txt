1. take a couple of ripe bananas, cut them into pieces and frost them for a few hours
2. take out the bananas and use a strong mixer or other device to thouroughly smash them into cream
3. Add honey, or cocoa or vanilla, or whatever you best like as ice cream flavour and whip it into the cream
=> there you go with a lactose-free, gluten-free and tasty ice cream with a rather minor banana taste to it
